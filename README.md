# Meal Planner: Don't waste your food
Android application created as a project for course "Mobile and Ubiquitous computing and applications" at Frederick University,
Nicosia, Cyprus.

This application is supposed to be an inventory of all the things you bought to eat, displaying information about the quantity
and expiration date of the product.

Main idea behind it is to waste less food, create less trash and overall reduce amount of waste we produce.

If you like this application, you can text me, maybe one day I will recreate it, but with better planning this time. If you are
looking for inspiration on how to write good code, you probably should look somewhere else.

# If you are looking for employees
I am looking for work (don't worry, I will learn more to avoid all the mistakes I made here).

PS. I made a lot of them :C
